    Oh, nearing the hour <br>
    So I been waiting so long <br>
    Hiding my power <br>
    After the calm lies the storm <br>
    Been walking the wire <br>
    Don't even know just how close <br>
    I've come to the fire <br>
    Should better watch it, oh <br>

    //--- <br>

    (Come, come, come) <br>
    Like waves in the ocean and <br>
    (Wrong, wrong, wrong) <br>
    Sway the emotions, too late (Slowly) <br>
    Already got me down low, low, low <br>
    No way to fight it <br>
    But you won't let me go <br>

    [Pre-Chorus] <br>
    Holy story <br>
    Rising from the shallow <br>
    Gonna face against the Devil <br>
    Higher fire <br>
    Look into the cold blue eyes <br>

    //--- <br>

    Whеn the midnight comes <br>
    Pullin' the strings, bеautiful monster <br>
    Royalty energy, I am yours <br>
    Playin' my heart, ain't no way I'm pure <br>
    Bow down and pray to ya <br>
    Nightwalker <br>
    Pullin' the strings, beautiful monster <br>
    Royalty energy, I am yours <br>
    Playin' my heart, ain't no way I'm pure <br>
    Bow down and pray <br>

    //--- <br>

    [Verse 2] <br>
    Next on the hitlist, that's my name <br>
    Oh, that's the hunter, I'm the prey <br>
    You make me lose it, go insane <br>
    And I need prescription for the pain <br>

    [Refrain] <br>
    (Come, come, come) <br>
    Like waves in the ocean and <br>
    (Done, done, done) <br>
    Yeah, I just let it flow, no time to reliev <br>
